# ðŸ¦  Coronito: another [corona-tracker.app](https://corona-tracker.app) 

### Corona / Covid-19 Tracker 

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-based WebApp for tracking Corona virus panic development.

It is also a PWA, so [you can install it](https://medium.com/progressivewebapps/how-to-install-a-pwa-to-your-device-68a8d37fadc1) on your mobile's home screen or on your desktop computer (mac afaik).

> PWA Installation instructions -> ["How to install a PWA to your device?"](https://medium.com/progressivewebapps/how-to-install-a-pwa-to-your-device-68a8d37fadc1) 

## ðŸ¥… Goals
1. Create a **clean and simple** pwa/web/mobile app for people to track and visualize the data they find the most useful. 
2. Offer context to emphasize a clear perspective (e.g. % of total world population, the flattening of the curve in countries that first fought the outbreak).
